About our group project

Update (18:43, Nov 3rd):
I uploaded a python code of computation of duration.

***

I submit the python code about Question 1 of SFO group project. This is coded by Jupyter Notebook, an interface of python. You can copy these directly to Spyder or .py or other python environment to run this.

This file is an example to calclulate frontline, CML and so on of stocks of Shanghai 50 Index. I have used it to finish another project in university before, and I just translate the notes in English.
